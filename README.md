This website introduces the user to the world of mechanical keyboard switches, and lets the user explore some example switches by viewing their profiles.
## Motivation
This project was created as a way for me to practice creating websites using HTML and CSS. By creating this project, I was able to learn how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox effectively.
## Features
- Page that teaches the user about mechanical keyboard switches (i.e. what they are, types of switches)
- Allows the user to choose a switch type and view some example switches
- Each example switch has its own information page that shows its specifications
