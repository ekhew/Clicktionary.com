        <h1>What is a Keyboard Switch?</h1>
        <p>Underneath every key of a mechanical keyboard is a small mechanism called a switch. The switch is what makes a mechanical keyboard "mechanical". Every keyboard switch falls under one of three types: clicky, tactile, and linear. Each type of switch vary in a way such that each have their own sound and feel.</p>

        <h2>Parts of a Switch</h2>

        <h4>Housing</h4>
        <p>The housing is the "case" of the switch. It is resposible for holding the entire mechanism together. The housing is consists of two parts, the upper and the bottom housing. The upper housing holds the stem of the switch in place, and the bottom housing connects the switch to the PCB of the keyboard.</p>
        <h4>Stem</h4>
        <p>The stem of the switch is the main piece that moves up and down when a key is pressed. On the top of the stem is a plus-shaped part where the keycap is connected to.</p>
        <h4>Spring</h4>
        <p>The spring is the part of the switch that allows the stem to bounce back up and "reset" to its original position prior to keypress.
        </p>
        <h4>Leaf</h4>
        <p>The leaf is the part of the switch that allows the keyboard to detect when a switch has been pressed. The stem moves down and makes contact with the leaf, and this registers a keypress onto the PCB.</p>
